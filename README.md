My project is about creating app that link QA students and to all the videos that are included in the their courses. The idea is to provide a solution that give a user in this case, a student the ability to log into the app and be taking to their dashboard where they will be presented with a couple of links to videos of courses already completed.

Some of the proposed capabilities of the app are as follows using MoSCoW prioritisation.:

Must Haves
- As a user, I want to be able to log so I can view my account.
- As a user I want to be able to reset my password if I forget
- As an Admin I want to be able to disable an account so I can de-register a user
- As a user I want to be to click a link and I can watch a video of my choice
- As a user I want to be sign out of my account to present other access after use


Should Have
As a user I want to be able to toggle text sizes to that I can increase font
As a user I want to be able to change/switch the background colour as necessary.


Although I implimented CRUD functionalities, CI/CD pipeline, SCM, I could not complete the project project before the deadline but will continue to work on it for future improvements.

I managed to used Jenkins as CI/CD pipeline and made sure it integrated with Github and updating accordingly. I also build the Docker image and pushed it to Dockerhub registry and deploed to a a Docker compose.
